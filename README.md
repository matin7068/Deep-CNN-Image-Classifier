# 🧠 Deep CNN Image Classifier  

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification project built using TensorFlow/Keras. This repository demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to classify images into categories using a custom dataset.

## 📌 Features  
- Preprocessing of dataset into training, validation, and test splits  
- Deep CNN model with multiple convolution + pooling layers  
- Implementation of activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid)  
- Model training and evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics  
- Visualization of predictions with matplotlib

## ⚙️ Installation  

1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matin7068/Deep-CNN-Image-Classifier.git
cd Deep-CNN-Image-Classifier
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)  
```bash
python3 -m venv venv

## 🖼 Dataset  
- The dataset should consist of labeled images organized into class folders.  
- Example structure:  
```
data/
│── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│── val/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│── test/
    ├── class_1/
    ├── class_2/
```
- You can use your own dataset or adapt public datasets (e.g., Kaggle).

## 🏗 Model Architecture  

The CNN is structured as follows:  

- **Input Layer:** (256 × 256 × 3) images  
- **Conv2D Layer:** 16 filters, (3×3), ReLU activation  
- **MaxPooling2D**  
- **Conv2D Layer:** 32 filters, (3×3), ReLU activation  
- **MaxPooling2D**  
- **Conv2D Layer:** 16 filters, (3×3), ReLU activation  
- **MaxPooling2D**  
- **Flatten Layer**  
- **Dense Layer:** 256 units, ReLU activation  
- **Output Layer:** 1 unit, Sigmoid activation (binary classification)

## 🚀 Usage  

### Train the model  
Run the notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

### Make predictions  
Inside the notebook, run the prediction cell to classify sample images.  

Example output:  
```
Predicted class is: Sad
```

## 📊 Results  

- Achieved **high accuracy** on training and validation sets (add your actual results here).  
- Model successfully distinguishes between the given classes.  
- Training/validation curves can be visualized in the notebook.  

---

## 📈 Future Improvements  
- Extend model for multi-class classification  
- Use transfer learning (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) for better performance  
- Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit
